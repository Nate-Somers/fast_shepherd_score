"""GPU/CPU acceleration for batch molecular alignment.

:mod:`~shepherd_score.accel.kernels` holds the Triton GPU kernels and their numba CPU
mirrors behind a per-call device dispatcher; :mod:`~shepherd_score.accel.drivers` the
batched coarse-to-fine SE(3) optimizers; :mod:`~shepherd_score.accel.batch`,
``cpu_pool`` and ``multi_gpu`` the orchestration (size bucketing, GPU-memory
sub-batching, CPU pool, multi-GPU data parallelism). The public entry point is the
``backend=`` argument on :meth:`shepherd_score.container.MoleculePairBatch.align_with_*`
(``"jax"``, ``"triton"``, ``"numba"``); :func:`align_multi_gpu` drives multi-GPU screens.
