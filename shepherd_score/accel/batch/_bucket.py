"""Mode-agnostic adaptive bucketer for the batched aligners.

The aligners group same-size pairs into one padded workspace per kernel launch; a fixed band
over-fragments a wide size distribution and over-pads a tight one, so :func:`plan_buckets`
plans per call from the :class:`PadSpec` a driver supplies. Kernels mask padding to the real
counts and seeds are keyed on real counts, so bucketing changes no result; it minimises padded
work plus a launch penalty, with pads snapped to ``_band_key`` multiples so the Triton autotune
cache stays small. ``merge`` dims are cost-driving and merged across; ``partition`` dims must
be uniform within a bucket and never merge across; ``masked`` dims pad to the bucket max.
