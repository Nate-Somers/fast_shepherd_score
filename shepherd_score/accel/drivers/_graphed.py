"""Generic CUDA-graph fine loop: capture one Adam optimisation step, replay it N times.

The per-pose fine loop is launch-bound at small and medium batch. One in-place step is captured
into a CUDA graph and replayed ``steps`` times; loop state lives in persistent buffers, so N
replays equal N eager steps with no per-step launch overhead. The base class owns capture and
replay; a subclass supplies its buffers, the step body (``_step``), bucket loading (``_load``),
the reset (``_reset``) and the result (``_result``). Kernels may allocate their outputs inside
the capture; what breaks it is a host sync or data-dependent control flow inside the step and
Python rebinding of loop-carried tensors. Autotune/JIT is warmed before capture in a side stream.
