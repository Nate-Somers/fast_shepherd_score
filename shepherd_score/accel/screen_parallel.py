"""Shard-parallel CPU screening: one strided library shard per forked, single-threaded worker.

Each ``align`` call has a single-threaded prologue, so in-call thread parallelism is
Amdahl-capped; whole independent aligns in separate worker processes are not. The featurized
library is stashed as a module global before the pool forks (inherited copy-on-write), and the
pool persists across calls for the same library object, keyed by its identity and length;
molecules mutated in place after the first call are not seen by the workers. Workers pin
themselves to one physical core each. Never run numba in this process before the first call for
a library: forking a process with a live GNU-OpenMP pool aborts the child.
