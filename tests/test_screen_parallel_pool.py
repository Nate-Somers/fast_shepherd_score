"""The shard-parallel CPU driver keeps its forked pool across calls against the same library.

Runs the driver in a SUBPROCESS on purpose: ``screen_parallel`` forks, and forking a process
that has already run a numba prange -- as this pytest process has by the time this file is
collected -- can abort the child under libgomp. A fresh interpreter is numba-clean, which is the
contract the driver's docstring states (featurise, then screen).
